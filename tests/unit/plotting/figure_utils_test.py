"""Unit tests targeting internal figure utils branches.

These focus on covering specific branches that were previously missed:
- prepare_figure with figsize=None when creating a new figure
- finalize_figure with own_figure=False and closefig=True (ignored + warns)
- _setup_axes_and_colormap warning when external ax is provided together with a non-None figsize
