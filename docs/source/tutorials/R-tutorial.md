## How to use pymovements in R

This guide shows how to use `pymovements` from R via the `reticulate` package.

---
### Install and load reticulate in R

```r
 install.packages("reticulate")
```
Load the package.
```r
library(reticulate)
```
### Installing pymovements.

```r
py_install("pymovements")
```
If this fails, create a dedicated python environment and make sure to point R to it.

#### Set up a dedicated environment
Skip this step if you already have an environment containing `pymovements`.

##### 1. using reticulate functionality in R
```r
reticulate::install_miniconda()
pymovements_packages <- c(
  "python==3.9",
  "pymovements"
)
reticulate::conda_create("pymovements_env", packages = pymovements_packages, pip = TRUE)
```

##### 2. using terminal

If you work with Conda:

```bash
conda create -n pymovements_env python=3.9 # supported: 3.9â€“3.13
conda activate pymovements_env
conda install -c conda-forge pymovements
```

If you prefer virtualenv:

```bash
python -m venv pymovements_env
# Activate the environment:
# macOS/Linux:
source pymovements_env/bin/activate
# Windows:
pymovements_env\Scripts\activate
pip install pymovements
```

#### Point R to use your Python environment

If you used Conda:
```r
use_condaenv("pymovements_env", required = TRUE)
```

If you used virtualenv:
```r
use_virtualenv("pymovements_env", required = TRUE)
```
### Working with pymovements

Import pymovements as `pm`.
```r
pm <- import("pymovements")
```

Now pymovements should appear as `pm` under values in your environment

Access functions and data within python modules and classes via the `$` operator

To test, you can proceed with the "pymovements in 10 minutes" tutorial,
for example this is how you download the ToyDataset:
```r
dataset = pm$Dataset('ToyDataset', path='data/ToyDataset')
dataset$download()
```

Now let's load in the dataset into R and display the found files:
```r
dataset$load()
dataset$fileinfo
```

### Related handy functions:

Load a python shell in R.
```r
repl_python()
```

Information about the version of Python currently being used by reticulate as well as which Python environment R sees:
```r
py_config()
```
Show all envs R can see:
```r
conda_list()
```
