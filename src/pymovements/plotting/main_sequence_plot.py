    Parameters
    ----------
    events: Events | EventDataFrame | None
        It must contain columns "peak_velocity" and "amplitude".
    marker_size: float
        Size of the marker symbol. (default: 25)
    color: str
        Color of the marker symbol. (default: 'purple')
    alpha: float
        Alpha value (=transparency) of the marker symbol. Between 0 and 1. (default: 0.5)
    marker: str
        Marker symbol. Possible values defined by matplotlib.markers. (default: 'o')
    figsize: tuple[int, int]
        Figure size. (default: (15, 5))
    title: str | None
        Figure title. (default: None)
    savepath: str | None
        If given, figure will be saved to this path. (default: None)
    show: bool
        If True, figure will be shown. (default: True)
    event_df: Events | EventDataFrame | None
        It must contain columns "peak_velocity" and "amplitude". (default: None)
    **kwargs: Collection
        Additional keyword arguments passed to matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.

    ------

        Those are needed to create the plot.
    ValueError
        If the event dataframe does not contain any saccades.
