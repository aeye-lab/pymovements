    """Download dataset resources.

    This downloads all resources of the dataset. Per default this also extracts all archives
    into :py:meth:`Dataset.paths.raw`,
    To save space on your device you can remove the archive files after
    successful extraction with ``remove_finished=True``.

    If a corresponding file already exists in the local system, its checksum is calculated and
    checked against the expected checksum.
    Downloading will be evaded if the integrity of the existing file can be verified.
    If the existing file does not match the expected checksum it is overwritten with the
    downloaded new file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    definition:
        The dataset definition.
    paths:
        The dataset paths.
    extract : bool
        Extract dataset archive files.
    remove_finished : bool
        Remove archive files after extraction.
    verbose : bool
        If True, show progress of download and print status messages for integrity checking and
        file extraction.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If number of mirrors or number of resources specified for dataset is zero.
    RuntimeError
        If downloading a resource failed for all given mirrors.
