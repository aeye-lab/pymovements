class DatasetDefinition:
    """Definition to initialize a :py:class:`~pymovements.Dataset`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the dataset.

    mirrors : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of mirrors of the dataset. Each entry must be of type `str` and end with a '/'.

    resources : tuple[dict[str, str], ...]
        A tuple of dataset resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    experiment : Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    filename_format : str
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_dtypes : dict[str, type], optional
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map : dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs : dict[str, Any], optional
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    distance_column : str | None
        The name of the column containing eye-to-screen distance in millimeters for each sample
        in the input data frame. If specified, the column will be used for pixel to dva
        transformations. If not specified, the constant eye-to-screen distance will be taken from
        the experiment definition.
