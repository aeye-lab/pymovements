    """Identification of fixations based on velocity-threshold (I-VT).

    The algorithm classifies each point as a fixation if the velocity is below
    the given velocity threshold. Consecutive fixation points are merged into
    one fixation.

    The implementation and its default parameter values are based on the description and pseudocode
    from Salvucci and Goldberg :cite:p:`SalvucciGoldberg2000`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    velocities: array-like, shape (N, 2)
        Corresponding continuous 2D velocity time series.
    timesteps: array-like, shape (N, )
        Corresponding continuous 1D timestep time series. If None, sample based timesteps are
        assumed.
    minimum_duration: int
        Minimum fixation duration. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``.
         If ``timesteps`` is None, then ``minimum_duration`` is specified in numbers of samples.
    velocity_threshold: float
        Threshold for a point to be classified as a fixation. If the
        velocity is below the threshold, the point is classified as a fixation.
    include_nan: bool
        Indicator, whether we want to split events on missing/corrupt value (np.nan)
    name:
        Name for detected events in EventDataFrame.

    Returns
    -------
    pl.DataFrame
        A dataframe with detected fixations as rows.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If velocities is None
        If velocities does not have shape (N, 2)
        If velocity threshold is None.
        If velocity threshold is not greater than 0.
