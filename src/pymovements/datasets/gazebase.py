class GazeBase(DatasetDefinition):
    """GazeBase dataset :cite:p:`GazeBase`.

    This dataset includes monocular (left eye) eye tracking data from 322 participants captured over
    a period of 37 months. Participants attended up to 9 rounds during this time frame, with each
    round consisting of two contiguous sessions.

    Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz using an EyeLink 1000 video-based
    eye tracker and are provided as positional data in degrees of visual angle.

    In each of the two sessions per round, participants are instructed to complete a series of
    tasks, including a fixation task (FIX), a horizontal saccade task (HSS), a random saccade task
    (RAN), a reading task (TEX), two free viewing video tasks (VD1 and VD2) and a gaze-driven gaming
    task (BLG).

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`GazeBase`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the dataset.

    mirrors : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of mirrors of the dataset. Each entry must be of type `str` and end with a '/'.

    resources : tuple[dict[str, str], ...]
        A tuple of dataset resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    experiment : Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    filename_format : str
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_dtypes : dict[str, type], optional
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map : dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs : dict[str, Any], optional
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.PublicDataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.GazeBase` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("GazeBase", path='data/GazeBase')

    Download the dataset resources resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
