@dataclass
class FakeNewsPerception(DatasetDefinition):
    """FakeNewsPerception dataset :cite:p:`FakeNewsPerception`.

    FakeNewsPerception dataset consists of eye movements during reading,
    perceived believability scores, and questionnaires including Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)
    and News-Find-Me (NFM) perception, collected from 25 participants with 60 news items.
    Eye movements are recorded to provide objective measures
    of information processing during news reading.

    For more details see :cite:p:`FakeNewsPerception`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    has_files: dict[str, bool]
        Indicate whether the dataset contains 'gaze', 'precomputed_events', and
        'precomputed_reading_measures'.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    experiment: Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, Any]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.
