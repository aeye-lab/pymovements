    InteRead dataset :cite:p:`InteRead`.

    This dataset includes monocular eye tracking data in an interrupted reading task.
    Automatic interruption occured during a reading task and participants continued
    reading after the pause.
    Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1200Hz with video-based eye tracker.
    Provided data are raw gaze samples and precomputed event files both in pixel coordinates.

    For more details, check the paper :cite:p:`InteRead`.
