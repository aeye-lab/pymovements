class UCL(DatasetDefinition):
    """UCL dataset :cite:p:`UCL`.

    UCL is a dataset of word-by-word reading times collected through
    self-paced reading and eye-tracking experiments to evaluate
    computational psycholinguistic models of English sentence comprehension.
    361 sentences from narrative sources, ensuring they were understandable without context,
    and recorded reading times from participants using both methods.

    For more details check out the original paper :cite:p:`UCL`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, Any]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.UCL` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("UCL", path='data/UCL')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
