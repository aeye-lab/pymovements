    """PoTeC dataset :cite:p:`potec`.

    The Potsdam Textbook Corpus (PoTeC) is a corpus of eye-tracking-while-reading data where
    participants (N=75) read a series of German short texts taken from college level textbooks
    of physics and biology. The experiments were conducted within a 2x2 fully-crossed factorial
    design with the readerâ€™s expertise (advanced vs beginner) and major (physics vs biology) as
    factors. Reading comprehension was assessed using text comprehension questions. Moreover,
    background questions that required additional knowledge beyond the presented text tested the
    general domain knowledge.
    The repository contains the eye-movement data (1000 Hz, right eye monocular) as well as the
    stimulus text data     with extensive linguistic feature annotations at the sub-lexical,
    lexical und supra-lexical     level. Therefore, the PoTeC is ideal for studying cognitive
    processes related to sentence     comprehension at all linguistic levels (e.g. lexical,
    syntactic, discourse) as well as higher-level text comprehension.

    Check the respective `repository <https://osf.io/dn5hp/>`_ for details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the dataset.

    mirrors : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of mirrors of the dataset. Each entry must be of type `str` and end with a '/'.

    resources : tuple[dict[str, str], ...]
        A tuple of dataset resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    experiment : Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    filename_format : str
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_dtypes : dict[str, type], optional
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map : dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs : dict[str, Any], optional
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.PublicDataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.PoTeC` definition:

    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("PoTeC", path='data/PoTeC')

    Download the dataset resources resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
