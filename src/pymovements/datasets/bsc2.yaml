    BSCII dataset :cite:p:`BSCII`.

    This dataset includes monocular eye tracking data from several participants in a single
    session. Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz using an EyeLink 1000
    eye tracker and precomputed events on aoi level are reported.

    The participant is instructed to read texts and answer questions. The original purpose was to
    look into the differences in processing when reading simplified and traditional Chinese.

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`BSCII`.
