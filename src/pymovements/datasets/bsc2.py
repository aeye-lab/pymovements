class BSCII(DatasetDefinition):
    """BSCII dataset :cite:p:`BSCII`.

    The Beijing Sentence Corpus II (BSCII) is a Traditional Chinese sentence corpus of eye-tracking
    data, based on the original Beijing Sentence Corpus (BSC) in Simplified Chinese. Data was
    collected from 60 native Traditional Chinese readers. The corpus enables analyses of word
    frequency, visual complexity, and predictability on fixation location and duration.
    
    Since the BSCII sentences are nearly identical to those in the BSC, the two corpora together
    provide a valuable resource for studying cross-script similarities and differences between
    Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
    
    Eye-movements were recorded with an Eyelink 1000 system at 1000 Hz.

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`BSCII`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    trial_columns: list[str]
            The name of the trial columns in the input data frame. If the list is empty or None,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain only one trial. If the list is not empty,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain multiple trials and the transformation
            methods will be applied to each trial separately.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.BSCII` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("BSCII", path='data/BSCII')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
