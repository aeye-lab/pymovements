@dataclass
class BSCII(DatasetDefinition):
    """BSCII dataset :cite:p:`BSCII`.

    This dataset includes monocular eye tracking data from a single participant in a single
    session. Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz using an EyeLink 1000
    eye tracker and precomputed events on aoi level are reported.

    The participant is instructed to read texts and answer questions. The original purpose was to
    look into the differences in processing when reading simplified and traditional Chinese.

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`BSCII`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    has_files: dict[str, bool]
        Indicate whether the dataset contains 'gaze', 'precomputed_events', and
        'precomputed_reading_measures'.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    trial_columns: list[str]
            The name of the trial columns in the input data frame. If the list is empty or None,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain only one trial. If the list is not empty,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain multiple trials and the transformation
            methods will be applied to each trial separately.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.SBSAT` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("SBSAT", path='data/SBSAT')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
    """

    # pylint: disable=similarities
    # The DatasetDefinition child classes potentially share code chunks for definitions.
