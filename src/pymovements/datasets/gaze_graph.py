class GazeGraph(DatasetDefinition):
    """GazeGraph dataset :cite:p:`GazeGraph`.

    The dataset is collected from eight subjects (four female and four male,
    aged between 24 and 35) using the Pupil Core eye tracker. During data collection,
    the subjects wear the eye tracker and sit in front of the computer screen
    (a 34-inch display) at a distance of approximately 50cm. We conduct the
    manufacturer's default on-screen five-points calibration for each of
    the subjects.
    Note that we have done only one calibration per subject, and the subjects
    can move their heads and upper bodies freely during the experiment.
    The gaze is recorded at a 30Hz sampling rate.

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`GazeGraph`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the dataset.

    mirrors : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of mirrors of the dataset. Each entry must be of type `str` and end with a '/'.

    resources : tuple[dict[str, str], ...]
        A tuple of dataset resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    experiment : Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    filename_format : str
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_dtypes : dict[str, type], optional
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map : dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs : dict[str, Any], optional
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.PublicDataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.GazeGraph` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("GazeGraph", path='data/GazeGraph')

    Download the dataset resources resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
