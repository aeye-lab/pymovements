@dataclass
class GazeGraph(DatasetDefinition):
    """GazeGraph dataset :cite:p:`GazeGraph`.

    The dataset is collected from eight subjects (four female and four male,
    aged between 24 and 35) using the Pupil Core eye tracker. During data collection,
    the subjects wear the eye tracker and sit in front of the computer screen
    (a 34-inch display) at a distance of approximately 50cm. We conduct the
    manufacturer's default on-screen five-points calibration for each of
    the subjects.
    Note that we have done only one calibration per subject, and the subjects
    can move their heads and upper bodies freely during the experiment.
    The gaze is recorded at a 30Hz sampling rate.

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`GazeGraph`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    experiment: Experiment
        The experiment definition.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    trial_columns: list[str]
            The name of the trial columns in the input data frame. If the list is empty or None,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain only one trial. If the list is not empty,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain multiple trials and the transformation
            methods will be applied to each trial separately.

    time_column: Any
        The name of the timestamp column in the input data frame. This column will be renamed to
        ``time``.

    time_unit: Any
        The unit of the timestamps in the timestamp column in the input data frame. Supported
        units are 's' for seconds, 'ms' for milliseconds and 'step' for steps. If the unit is
        'step' the experiment definition must be specified. All timestamps will be converted to
        milliseconds.

    pixel_columns: list[str]
        The name of the pixel position columns in the input data frame. These columns will be
        nested into the column ``pixel``. If the list is empty or None, the nested ``pixel``
        column will not be created.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.GazeGraph` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("GazeGraph", path='data/GazeGraph')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
