    GazeBase dataset :cite:p:`GazeBase`.

    This dataset includes monocular (left eye) eye tracking data from 322 participants captured over
    a period of 37 months. Participants attended up to 9 rounds during this time frame, with each
    round consisting of two contiguous sessions.

    Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz using an EyeLink 1000 video-based
    eye tracker and are provided as positional data in degrees of visual angle.

    In each of the two sessions per round, participants are instructed to complete a series of
    tasks, including a fixation task (FIX), a horizontal saccade task (HSS), a random saccade task
    (RAN), a reading task (TEX), two free viewing video tasks (VD1 and VD2) and a gaze-driven gaming
    task (BLG).
