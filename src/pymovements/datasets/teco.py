@dataclass
class TECO(DatasetDefinition):
    """TECO dataset :cite:p:`TECO`.

    The Tsukuba Eye-tracking Corpus (TECO) provides eye-tracking data from 41 Japanese
    learners of English, who read 30 English passages with a total of over 410,000 tokens.

    This dataset includes detailed eye-movement measures such as skipping,
    first fixation duration, and regression, offering insights into the cognitive processes
    underlying second-language reading. TECO also examines the impact of lexical and reader factors,
    like word length and reading proficiency, on eye-tracking behavior.

    The dataset aims to support research on L2 reading comprehension.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    trial_columns: list[str]
            The name of the trial columns in the input data frame. If the list is empty or None,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain only one trial. If the list is not empty,
            the input data frame is assumed to contain multiple trials and the transformation
            methods will be applied to each trial separately.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.TECO` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("TECO", path='data/TECO')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
