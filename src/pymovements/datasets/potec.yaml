    PoTeC dataset :cite:p:`PoTeC`.

    The Potsdam Textbook Corpus (PoTeC) is a naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading
    corpus containing data from 75 participants reading 12 scientific texts.
    PoTeC is the first naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading corpus that contains
    eye-movements from domain-experts as well as novices in a within-participant
    manipulation: It is based on a 2×2×2 fully-crossed factorial design which includes
    the participants' level of study and the participants' discipline of study as
    between-subject factors and the text domain as a within-subject factor. The
    participants' reading comprehension was assessed by a series of text comprehension
    questions and their domain knowledge was tested by text-independent
    background questions for each of the texts. The materials are annotated for a
    variety of linguistic features at different levels. We envision PoTeC to be used
    for a wide range of studies including but not limited to analyses of expert and
    non-expert reading strategies.

    The corpus and all the accompanying data at all
    stages of the preprocessing pipeline and all code used to preprocess the data are
    made available via `GitHub. <https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/PoTeC>`_
