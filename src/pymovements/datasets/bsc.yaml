    This dataset includes monocular eye tracking data from several participants in a single
    session. Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz using an EyeLink 1000
    eye tracker and precomputed events on aoi level are reported.

    The participant is instructed to read texts and answer questions.
